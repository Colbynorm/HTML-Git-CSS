                My name is Colby Norman and I am currently enrolled in a coding course. With enrolling in this course I am hoping to learn a new skill and start a new profession.
                I am from Arlington, Tx and graduated high school in 2013.
                My favorite hobbies include playing basketball, working out and reading in my spare time. My favorite basketball team is the Dallas Mavericks,
                and my favorite aurthor is Stephen King.
